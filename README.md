# Rick & Morty Team Builder

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It was to see how far I could create within 3hrs, particularly for the MVP.

## Getting Started

First, install the packages

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Or visit [rickandmorty-teambuilder.vercel.app](https://rickandmorty-teambuilder.vercel.app/) to see it deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
